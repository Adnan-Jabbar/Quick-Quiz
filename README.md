Quick Quiz allows you to load questions in a json format and then answer those questions in the form of a Quiz.

The format is the following:
```
"Question":
{
            "question": "Q 5 - Which of the following is the default access specifier of a class?",
            "answerA": "A - Internal",
            "answerB": "B - Private",
            "answerC": "C - Public",
            "answerD": "D - Protected",
            "correctAnswer": "A - Internal"
}
```
